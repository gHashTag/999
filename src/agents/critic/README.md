# Critic Agent Documentation

**Purpose:** This agent is responsible for reviewing the code and tests generated by other agents (Coder, Tester) based on the initial task and the defined TDD workflow.

## Structure

- `index.ts`: Exports the public API of the critic agent module.
- `logic/`: Contains the core logic for creating the critic agent (`createCriticAgent.ts`).
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions specifically used by the critic agent (e.g., `extractCritiqueData.ts`).

## Usage

The critic agent is invoked by the network router (`src/network.ts`) when the state indicates that either tests (`NEEDS_TEST_CRITIQUE`) or implementation code (`NEEDS_CODE_CRITIQUE`) require review.
